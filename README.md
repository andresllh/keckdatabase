## The database for the W.M. Keck Center for 3D Innovation is under development.

## Installation for local development
### Requirements 
In order to run the application and database locally, the following things must be installed on your computer:
  1. Python 3.6
  2. Sqlite
  
Using pip, you will also need to install the following libraries for python 3.
  1. Pandas
  2. Numpy
  3. SQLAlchemy
  4. wtforms
  5. Flask
  
## How to run
Once all requirements have been installed, go ahead and clone the repository or download the files.
After all files are in a folder, navigate to that folder in your command prompt and run the app using
the command "py app.py" or "python app.py" depending on which one utilizes python 3. Once the server
is running, open up a browser and navigate to "localhost:4000" to view it.

## How to add more dropdown options
There is an excel file called dropdowns.xls, which contains all the filtering dropdown options
that are listed in the search page. To add more options, simply modify this file by adding the 
option directly underneath the column where you want it to be displayed.
